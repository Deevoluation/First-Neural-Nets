    "- A network with 5 neurons in the hidden layer and 3 neurons in the output layer was constructed. The network was trained for 500 epochs with a learning rate of 0.3. These parameters were found with a little trial and error, but you may be able to do much better.\n",

    "- **More Layers.** Add support for more hidden layers, trained in just the same way as the one hidden layer used in this tutorial.\n",
    "- **Regression.** Change the network so that there is only one neuron in the output layer and that a real value is predicted. Pick a regression dataset to practice on. A linear transfer function could be used for neurons in the output layer, or the output values of the chosen dataset could be scaled to values between 0 and 1.\n",
